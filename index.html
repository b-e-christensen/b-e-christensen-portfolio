                <p>I am a full stack web developer that has a great passion for the craft. To be able to build something out of nothing - going from a blank file to hundreds, thousands of lines of code - is a great feeling and one that I cherish being able to have. Whether it be working in the front or back end, or handling both, taking a project from the humble beginnings of that first whiteboard meeting (or some simple scrawlings on a napkin) and seeing it turn into an MVP,  into a fully fleshed out application, is an experience that I love being able to be a part of on a regulara basis. I will treat your project ideas with this same fervor and look forward to working with you.</p>
                <!-- working on an about me that doesn't sound horrendously cheesy/disingenious. -->
                <!-- <p>I got into coding to get into something fun and exciting. To be able to create something to be proud of, to lay it next to the likes of great literature, music, art and have it not be out of place. There is so much in this world that can be done with coding and programming and I am very happy and proud to be a part of the people that are out there trying to make something beautiful everyday. </p> -->
