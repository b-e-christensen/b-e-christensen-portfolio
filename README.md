to do (as far as things needed to be added and not like, ~make code look prettier~)

mailing list submissions -- (probably wont be doing this actually)
image editing software (gimp is one i could use) to shrink image sizes to help with loading time of them 

--- 
definitely need to update cards with new unique images and finish the layout of them with title of project names 
Add an about me that is in english. 
update title. 
copy and paste over the reset css that was in last weeks activities.

may want to change how the .description displays at 414px. I think we could put the h2 element at the top, and the description printed below it. basically just rewrite all of the .description for phones specifically. 
i believe that that is about it.
